Hi Abama,

I've attached the latest release (13) of the 6565 s/w.

 

You only need to install the 6500 update (not the 6565a.hex)

 

Sorry for the delay again. When we looked at your problem we found some others which needed fixing.

 

Hopefully,  this should sort your issues.

 

I would suggest using the :ANA:TRIG2 command (rather than :TRIG) and add an 'ABORT SWEEP' button, which sends the following commands

 

*SW-ABORT

:ANA:BIAS-STAT OFF

 

This means that if something goes wrong during the sweep, the user can abort the sweep. If the :TRIG command is used it is difficult to abort the sweep

 

Best Regards,

Ian

HI Ian,

I have modify the excel file to control 6500+6565, I find read data from 6500 has a little problem,

can you check the attached file?

Best regards,

Hi Abama,

 

Using a 1J1026 fixture, up to 2 6565s can be connected.

Using a 1J1027 fixture, up to 4 6565s can be connected.

***************************************************************************************

With the 6565, the bias cannot be set to zero, the minimum is 1mA. So for 0A, the bias should be turned off.

 

*************************************************************************************

I've attached the latest s/w which hopefully fixes all the GPIB issues.

You will notice that the update pack contains a '6565A.hex' file, which is a 6565 s/w update. I would suggest that unless you see any unusual behaviour from the 6565, that you do not update the 6565 until you have got software working.

If you start seeing problems during the  BIAS sweep then you will need to update the 6565.

I will send you the instructions for 6565 update in a separate e-mail.

 

The 6500 update procedure remains the same.

***************************************************************************************

 

The suggested command sequence I sent you previously appears to work now BUT the *SYSBIAS command I gave you was incorrect

It should be *SYSBIAS 'BIAS EXT'  to select 6565

 

 

NOTE:-

When the bias is turned on (:ANA:BIAS-STAT ON) before a sweep is triggered, the current will NOT be set to the ':ANA:START' value. It will be set to the ':ANA:BIAS' value.

 

e.g. with the following settings:

:ANA:BIAS 1.0

:ANA:START 0.01

:ANA:START 0.5

 

When the bias is turned on, the current will be set to 1.0 Amp.

When the sweep is triggered, the current will drop to 0.01 Amps before rising to 0.5 Amps

Therefore, use the :ANA:BIAS command to set the initial conditions

 

Best Regards,

Ian

Hi Ian,

Another question, How can I know How many sets of 6565 connected to 6500?

Hi Abama,

Yes, although the *SYSBIAS command will not work correctly. This is not a problem if EXT bias is selected manually.

Best Regards,

Ian

Hi Ian ,

 

If analysis mode has problems, can I use meter mode instead?

Hi Abama,

 

Luke tells me this is for a customer application. I don't know how you were planning to do this but I would have thought that modifying the Excal LAN program would be quite a quick solution.

 

The new GPIB commands are written but not documented. The existing bias commands (e.g :BIAS 10.0, BIAS-STAT ON ) are used with the addition of the following:

 

*SYSBIAS 'EXT'           :- selects External bias mode.  Options 'INT', 'EXT' and 'NONE'  (it needs the single quote i.e 'EXT' not just EXT)

*SYSBIAS?                  :- reads BIAS setting 

:ANA:PAR BIAS  :- selectes BIAS sweep . Option FREQ , BIAS, LEVEL

 

So I think to set up a Bias sweep the following command sequence is needed:

 

*SYSBIAS 'EXT'   //enable external bias

:ANA

:ANA:PAR BIAS  // bias sweep

:ANA:STOP 10.0

:ANA:START 1.0

:ANA:BIAS-STAT ON    //bias on before trigger

:ANA:TRIG

:ANA:BIAS-STAT OFF  //bias off after trigger

 

If you decide to implement it using Analysis mode then I suggest you use :ANA:TRIG2 rather than :ANA:TRIG.

:ANA:TRIG2 can be aborted during the sweep by sending the *SW-ABORT command which is probably a good idea with high current bias sweeps.

*SW-STATUS? can be used to check the status of the sweep

 

KNOWN BUGS:

There are bugs in the following:

*SYSBIAS  (doesn't work but can be selected manually for testing)

:ANA:START and :ANA:STOP when BIAS sweep is selected (don't work but can be set manually for testing)

:ANA:TRIG2 when BIAS sweep is selected (doesn't work)

 

We will try and fix these ASAP and let you have an update

 

Best Regards,

Ian

Hi Ian,

Do you have done 6565 gpib command yet?

If you have done, pls give me a copy.

Thanks.

Best Regards,

Abama
